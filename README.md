### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I do web development. I like data intensive applications, because they really get my brain workin'. I've mainly done Ruby and JavaScript. I prefer to use Elixir now, as it's better suited for the multi-core distributed World of Tomorrow.

> The best code is no code at all

I'm currently working as a full-stack contractor.
