### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I do web development. I like data intensive applications. I've mainly done Ruby and JavaScript, and have gotten more into Elixir as a technology of choice. 

Single-threaded things are hard to scale, which is why I look for tech that solves the hard problems for you, so that I don't have to.

I'm currently working for the University of Hawaii, building an [event-sourced system](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html).
