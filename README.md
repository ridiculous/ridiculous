### Hi there 👋

I do web development. I like data intensive applications, because they really get my brain workin'. I've mainly done Ruby and JavaScript. I prefer to use Elixir now, as it's better suited for the multi-core distributed World of Tomorrow.

I'm currently working for the University of Hawaii, building an [event-sourced system](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html).
