### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I do web development, and data intensive applications. I've mainly done Ruby and JavaScript, and have gotten more into Elixir as a technology of choice. Single-threaded things are hard to scale, and I'm looking for tech that moves us forward by solving hard problems, so that I can focus on building cool stuff.

I'm currently working for the University of Hawaii, building an [event-sourced system](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html).
